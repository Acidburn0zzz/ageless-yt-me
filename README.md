## Ageless for YouTube (Moon Edition)

With [Ageless](https://github.com/JustOff/ageless-yt-me/releases) you can watch age restricted Youtube videos in Pale Moon without signing in. By the push of a button the age restricted video will open in a new tab and you will be able to watch it. Ageless does not work for videos where the video owner has disabled playback on other websites.
